# PREDICTION: Holographic Phase Transition at KBC Void Boundary

**Author:** [Michael Ricard]  
**https://github.com/erbetal-dotcom/The-Holographic-Phase-Transition-Theorem  
**Date of Prediction:** January 17, 2026  
**Status:** ⏳ AWAITING EUCLID DR1 DATA (Expected Q2-Q3 2026)

---

## Core Principle

Cosmological expansion is limited by information **flux** through the holographic boundary (πR²), not information **capacity** (4πR²).

**Fundamental Constant:** K = π (exactly)

---

## Specific Testable Predictions

### Location
**KBC Void Boundary:** z ≈ 0.07 (comoving distance r ≈ 600 Mpc)

### Observable Signatures

| Parameter | Predicted Value | Physical Meaning |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| **Velocity Jump** | Δv = 3,600 ± 400 km/s | Discrete expansion rate change |
| **Transition Width** | Δr = 31.8 ± 8 Mpc | Calculated from Δr = ξ_corr / π |
| **Transition Shape** | Sharp step (Heaviside) | NOT smooth gradient |
| **Directional Asymmetry** | >95% outward | Jumps positive from void centers |

---

## Confirmation Criteria

**K = π is CONFIRMED if Euclid DR1 shows ALL of:**

1. ✓ Transition width: 20 < Δr < 50 Mpc (measured at >3σ)
2. ✓ Velocity amplitude: 3,000 < Δv < 4,200 km/s
3. ✓ Sharp transition: Bayes Factor (step vs. gradient) > 5
4. ✓ Asymmetry: >90% of jumps positive (outward direction)
5. ✓ Consistency: ≥3 independent void samples agree (within 2σ)

**Detection Significance:** >20σ if prediction is correct

---

## Falsification Criteria

**K = π is FALSIFIED if ANY of:**

1. ✗ Transition too smooth: Δr > 100 Mpc (implies K < 1)
2. ✗ Transition too sharp: Δr < 15 Mpc (implies K > 10)
3. ✗ No structure: Bayes Factor (null vs. step) > 3
4. ✗ Wrong amplitude: Δv outside [2,000, 5,000] km/s range
5. ✗ Inconsistent: Independent sightlines disagree at >3σ

## Distinguishing from Alternative Models

| Model | Transition Width | Velocity Jump | Mechanism |
|-------|-----------------|---------------|-----------|
| **ΛCDM** | No transition | 0 km/s | Dark energy (Λ) |
| **Timescape** | >200 Mpc | ~800 km/s | Gravitational time dilation |
| **K = π** | **31.8 Mpc** | **3,600 km/s** | **Information flux saturation** |

**Key Discriminator:** Transition width Δr uniquely identifies the model.

## Timeline

- **Jan 17, 2026:** Prediction published (this document)
- **Q2-Q3 2026:** Euclid DR1 spectroscopic data release (~50M galaxies)
- **Q3 2026:** Community analysis begins
- **Q4 2026:** Confirmation or falsification at >10σ significance

---

## Physical Interpretation

**If confirmed, this demonstrates:**
- Information theory governs cosmological dynamics
- Holographic principle applies to cosmic expansion
- π appears as a fundamental cosmological constant (flux aperture limit)
- Hubble tension resolved: local (flux-limited) vs. global (capacity-limited) regimes

**If falsified, this constrains:**
- K ≠ π, requiring different geometric model
- Or holographic flux limitation doesn't govern void dynamics
- Hubble tension requires alternative explanation

---

## Data Requirements

**Surveys capable of testing:**
- ✓ Euclid DR1 (2026): 50M spectra, σ_v ≈ 90 km/s
- ✓ DESI Y5 (2025-26): 40M spectra, independent confirmation
- ✓ Future: LSST, SKA (higher redshift tests)

**Analysis needed:**
- Velocity field reconstruction at z = 0.06-0.08
- Step function detection (Bayesian model comparison)
- Stacking analysis across multiple void boundaries

## Declaration

**This prediction was made BEFORE Euclid DR1 data is publicly available.**

The specific numerical values (Δv = 3,600 km/s, Δr = 31.8 Mpc, K = π) are:
- Not fitted to observational data
- Derived from geometric principles
- Independently testable
- Falsifiable within 6-9 months
