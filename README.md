# The Holographic Phase Transition Theorem

A Geometric Proof that Spherical Information Boundaries Exhibit Universal Critical Threshold Constant π.

This repository contains Python scripts and markdown documentation exploring the **Causal Information Completion of General Relativity (CIC-GR)** and related toy models for phase transitions in spherical information boundaries.
