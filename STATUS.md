# Prediction Status Tracker

## Prediction Made
**Date:** January 17, 2026
**Commit:** [link to first commit]

## Current Status
⏳ **AWAITING DATA** - Euclid DR1 expected Q2-Q3 2026

## What We're Waiting For
- Euclid spectroscopic survey data release
- DESI Y5 data (complementary)
- ~50M galaxy redshifts at z ≈ 0.07

## Expected Timeline
- **Q2 2026:** Euclid DR1 data public release
- **Q3 2026:** Community analysis begins
- **Q4 2026:** Confirmation or falsification

## Falsification Threshold
This prediction can be definitively ruled out if:
- No velocity structure detected at z ≈ 0.07 (>3σ null result)
- Transition width Δr > 100 Mpc (suggests K < 1)
- Transition width Δr < 15 Mpc (suggests K > 10)
